# Image-Classification

Objective: Classifying Images from the CIFAR100 dataset with an interactive UI 

Workflow:
1) Collect data from the CIFAR100 dataset with built in python libraries.
2) Perform data cleaning, data augmentation, and display sample data to the user.
3) Train the model for 10,20,50 and 100 epochs and perform transfer learning for better model accuracy.
4) Use streamlit for the UI in which the output graphs are shown (accuracy & loss v/s number of epochs).
5) Let the upload a sample image and the output will be classified in real time.
